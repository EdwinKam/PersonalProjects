<h1>CISW306–Edwin K -Project2–Spring 2020 </h1>
<h2>Prargraphs</h2>
<p>I went to Japan last summer. It was all fun. I love travelling becasue I like to look at new things.
This year I want to go to Korea, I like travelling to Asia beacause I like the Asian culture. I like taking pictures in the big buildings.<br/></p>

<p>I went to SF for a concert last week. There were so many people. The traffic was so heavy down there, my uber can't even find us.</p>

<p>This week is a busy week. I have one Lab report due on wednesday but I still haven't start it. Also, there are two jorney writings for my English class. I wish I have 48 hours a day to work my homework. </p>
